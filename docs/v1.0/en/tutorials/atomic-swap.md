# Transfer AVAX tokens between Chains

## Introduction

AVAX tokens exist on both the X-Chain, where they can be traded, and the P-Chain, where they can be provided as a stake when validating the Primary Network.
Avalanche supports **atomic swaps** of AVAX between the X-Chain and P-chain. (In the future Avalanche will support more generic atomic swaps between chains.)
In this tutorial we'll send AVAX tokens between the X-Chain, P-Chain and C-Chain.

## Requirements

We assume that you've already done the [quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) and are familiar with the [Avalanche Network's architecture.](../core-concepts/overview.md)

## Export AVAX from the X-Chain to the P-Chain

Of course, in order to send AVAX you need to have some AVAX!
Use the [Public Tesnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) to send some AVAX to an X-Chain address you hold, just like in the quickstart guide.

To send the AVAX, call the X-Chain's [`exportAVAX`](../api/avm.md#avmexportavax) method.

Your call should look like this:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.exportAVAX",
    "params" :{
        "to":"P-avax1wkmfja9ve3lt3n9ye4qp3l3gj9k2mz7ep45j7q",
        "destinationChain": "P",
        "amount": 5000000,
        "changeAddr": "X-avax1turszjwn05lflpewurw96rfrd3h6x8flgs5uf8",
        "username":"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

where `to` is the address of a P-Chain address you hold and `changeAddr` is the address to send any change to.
You can leave `changeAddr` blank; if you do, change will be returned to an address controlled by your user.
(See [here](../api/platform.md#platformcreateaddress) for instructions on creating a new P-Chain address.)

Note that you will pay a transaction fee for both the export and import operations. In this example, let's assume the transaction fee is `1,000,000` nAVAX. Then the above export actually consumes `6,000,000` nAVAX; `5,000,000` goes to the P-Chain and `1,000,000` is burned as a transaction fee.

Make sure that the amount that you're sending exceeds the transaction fee.
Otherwise, when you import the AVAX on the P-Chain it will consume the transaction fee and you'll end up with _less_ AVAX on the P-Chain.

The response should look like this:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "txID": "MqEaeWc4rfkw9fhRMuMTN7KUTNpFmh9Fd7KSre1ZqTsTQG73h",
        "changeAddr": "X-avax1turszjwn05lflpewurw96rfrd3h6x8flgs5uf8",
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

We can verify that this transaction was accepted by calling `getTxStatus`:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "avm.getTxStatus",
    "params":{
        "txID":"MqEaeWc4rfkw9fhRMuMTN7KUTNpFmh9Fd7KSre1ZqTsTQG73h"
    },
    "id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

Which shows our transaction is accepted:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "status": "Accepted"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

We can also call [`getBalance`](../api/avm.md#avmgetbalance) to check that the AVAX was deducted from an address held by our user:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getBalance",
    "params" :{
        "address":"X-ADDRESSGOESHERE",
        "assetID":"AVAX"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

The amount deducted is the exported amount (`5,000,000` in this example) plus the transaction fee. If your user controls multiple X-Chain addresses, the AVAX may have been sent from any combination of them.

## Import AVAX to the P-Chain from the X-Chain

Our transfer isn't done just yet. We need to call the P-Chain's [`importAVAX`](../api/platform.md#platformimportavax) method to finish the transfer.

Your call should look like this:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "platform.importAVAX",
    "params": {
        "to":"P-avax1wkmfja9ve3lt3n9ye4qp3l3gj9k2mz7ep45j7q",
        "sourceChain":"X",
        "changeAddr":"P-avax103y30cxeulkjfe3kwfnpt432ylmnxux8r73r8u",
        "username":"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword"
    },
    "id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/P
```

This returns the transaction ID:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "txID": "2sxo3ySETZ4xzXqAtgsUvZ5pdkqG4SML4c7Z7NoKLZcp77YNXC",
        "changeAddr":"P-avax103y30cxeulkjfe3kwfnpt432ylmnxux8r73r8u"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

We can check that the transaction was accepted with:


```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getTxStatus",
    "params" :{
        "txID":"2sxo3ySETZ4xzXqAtgsUvZ5pdkqG4SML4c7Z7NoKLZcp77YNXC"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

It should be `Committed`, meaning the transfer is complete.
We can also check the balance of the address with:


```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "platform.getBalance",
    "params":{
        "address":"P-avax1wkmfja9ve3lt3n9ye4qp3l3gj9k2mz7ep45j7q"
    },
    "id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/P
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "balance": "4000000",
        "utxoIDs": [
            {
                "txID": "2sxo3ySETZ4xzXqAtgsUvZ5pdkqG4SML4c7Z7NoKLZcp77YNXC",
                "outputIndex": 0
            }
        ]
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

Note that the balance we see is the amount exported from the X-Chain (`5,000,000`) less the transaction fee (`1,000,000` in this example.)
Now we can use the AVAX held by this P-Chain address to provide a stake in order to validate the Primary Network.

## Export AVAX from the P-Chain to the X-Chain

Now let's move AVAX on the P-Chain back to the X-Chain.

To do so, call [`platform.exportAVAX`](../api/platform.md#platformexportavax):

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "platform.exportAVAX",
    "params": {
        "to":"X-avax1fjn5rffqvny7uk3tjegjs6snwjs3hhgcpcxfax",
        "amount":3000000,
        "changeAddr":"P-avax103y30cxeulkjfe3kwfnpt432ylmnxux8r73r8u",
        "username":"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword"
    },
    "id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/P
```

where `to` is the X-Chain address the AVAX is being sent to.

This returns the transaction ID, and we can check that the transaction was committed with another call to `platform.getTxStatus`. Again, make sure that the amount you're sending exceeds the transaction fee.

## Import AVAX to the X-Chain from the P-Chain

To finish our transfer from the P-Chain to the X-Chain, call `avm.importAVAX`:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.importAVAX",
    "params" :{
        "to":"X-avax1fjn5rffqvny7uk3tjegjs6snwjs3hhgcpcxfax",
        "sourceChain":"P",
        "username":"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

Note that `to` is the same address specified in our call to `platform.exportAVAX`.

Just as before, we can call `avm.getBalance` to verify the funds were received.
The balance should have increased by `3,000,000`, less the transaction fee.

## Export AVAX from the X-Chain to the C-Chain	

In addition to sending AVAX between the X-Chain and P-Chain, you can also send AVAX between the X-Chain and the C-Chain and back. The X-Chain uses Bech32 addresses and the C Chain uses hex EVM addresses. There is no way to convert the address from one format to the other since they are both derived from a private key using a one way cryptographic function.

In order to get around this, you can export a private key from the X-Chain and then import it to the C-Chain. This way you can use the X-Chain address and change the X- prefix to a C- prefix in order to get the correct Bech32 address to use for the C-Chain.

First, export a private key from the X Chain:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.exportKey",
    "params" :{
        "username" :"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword",
        "address": "X-avax1jggdngzc9l87rgurmfu0z0n0v4mxlqta0h3k6e"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

Response:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "result" :{
        "privateKey":"PrivateKey-2w4XiXxPfQK4TypYqnohRL8DRNTz9cGiGmwQ1zmgEqD9c9KWLq"
    }
}
```

Now import the same private key to the C Chain:

```json
curl -X POST --data '{  
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"avax.importKey", 
    "params" :{ 
        "username" :"myUsername",   
        "password":"myPassword",    
        "privateKey":"PrivateKey-2w4XiXxPfQK4TypYqnohRL8DRNTz9cGiGmwQ1zmgEqD9c9KWLq"    
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax
``` 

The response contains a hex encoded EVM address:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "address": "0x5Bf544EF123FE41B262295dBA41c5a9CFA8efDB4"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

Now you can use the address corresponding to the private key you exported and switch to using the C- prefix in the avm.exportAVAX call:

```json	
curl -X POST --data '{	
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",	
    "id"     :1,	
    "method" :"avm.exportAVAX",	
    "params" :{	
        "to":"C-avax1jggdngzc9l87rgurmfu0z0n0v4mxlqta0h3k6e",	
        "destinationChain": "C",	
        "amount": 5000000,	
        "username":"myUsername",	
        "password":"myPassword"	
    }	
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X	
```	

Since your keystore user owns the corresponding private key on the C-Chain, you can now import the AVAX to the address of your choice. It's not necessary to import it to the same address that it was exported to, so can import it directly to an address that you own in MetaMask or another third party service.

```json
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"avax.importAVAX",    
    "params" :{ 
        "to":"0x4b879aff6b3d24352Ac1985c1F45BA4c3493A398",  
        "sourceChain":"X",  
        "username":"myUsername",    
        "password":"myPassword" 
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax
```

where `to` is a hex encoded EVM address of your choice.

The response look like this:

```json
{   
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",   
    "result": { 
        "txID": "LWTRsiKnEUJC58y8ezAk6hhzmSMUCtemLvm3LZFw8fxDQpns3" 
    },  
    "id": 1 
}
```

Note: there is no transaction fee for import transactions to the C Chain.


Once your AVAX have been transferred to the C-Chain you can immediately begin running smart contracts. See the ["Deploy a smart contract"](https://docs.avax.network/v1.0/en/tutorials/deploy-a-smart-contract/) for more info.	

## Export AVAX from the C-Chain to the X-Chain	

Now you can move AVAX back from the C-Chain to the X-Chain	

```json	
curl -X POST --data '{	
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",	
    "id"     :1,	
    "method" :"avax.exportAVAX",
    "params" :{	
        "to":"X-avax1wkmfja9ve3lt3n9ye4qp3l3gj9k2mz7ep45j7q",	
        "amount": 5000000,	
        "username":"myUsername",	
        "password":"myPassword"	
    }	
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax	
```	

where `to` is the bech32 encoded address of an X-Chain address you hold. Make sure that the amount you export exceeds the transaction fee because both the export and import transactions will charge a transaction fee.

The response should look like this:	

```json	
{	
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",	
    "result": {	
        "txID": "2ZDt3BNwzA8vm4CMP42pWD242VZy7TSWYUXEuBifkDh4BxbCvj"	
    },	
    "id": 1	
}	
```	

## Import AVAX to the X-Chain from the C-Chain	

Lastly, we can finish up by importing AVAX from the C-Chain to the X-Chain, call `avm.importAVAX`.	

```json	
curl -X POST --data '{	
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",	
    "id"     :1,	
    "method": "avm.importAVAX",	
    "params": {	
        "username":"myUsername",	
        "password":"myPassword",	
        "sourceChain": "C",	
        "to":"X-avax1wkmfja9ve3lt3n9ye4qp3l3gj9k2mz7ep45j7q"	
    }	
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X	
```	

where `to` is the bech32 encoded address the X-Chain address which you sent the funds to in the previous step.	

The response should look like this:	

```json	
{	
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",	
    "result": {	
        "txID": "2kxwWpHvZPhMsJcSTmM7a3Da7sExB8pPyF7t4cr2NSwnYqNHni"	
    },	
    "id": 1	
}	
```

## Wrapping Up

That's it! Now you can swap AVAX back and forth between the X-Chain and P-Chain. In the future Avalanche will support more generalized atomic swaps between chains.
