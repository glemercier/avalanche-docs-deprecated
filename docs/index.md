## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is:

* A heterogeneous network of custom, interoperable blockchains and custom validator sets
* A platform for defining, launching and maintaining custom blockchains
* A platform for creating and trading smart digital assets
* A way to store and transfer value without a centralized entity

## Key Features

### Speed

The Avalanche platform uses a novel consensus protocol created by distributed systems researchers in 2018, also called "Avalanche", to permanently confirm transactions in 1-2 seconds.

### Scalability

Avalanche handles thousands of transactions per second and can accommodate thousands of validators with no loss of performance.

### Security

Avalanche provides stronger security guarantees than either classical or longest-chain consensus protocols.

### Smart Contract Support

Avalanche supports [creation and use of Solidity smart contracts](v1.0/en/tutorials/deploy-a-smart-contract.md) as well as all your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix, Metamask, Truffle and more.

### Private/public Blockchains

Users can create their own public or private blockchains.

### Finance-focused

Avalanche was built with serving financial markets in mind.
It has native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex custom rulesets that define how the asset is handled and traded.
The assets could represent financial instruments such as equities, bonds, debt,
fractionalized real estate, or anything else.
